        <div class = "aboutart"></div>

        <div class = "artinfo">Artgenda is short for Art Agenda, according to Cambridge Dictionary, Agenda is defined as a list of aims or possible future achievements. The word agenda is the plural for of the Latin word agendum, which literally means "something to be done." On the other hand, Art has a broad meaning, Art is more than a hobby, it is a burning passion that lights a fire in people's souls. For me, your passion has a lot of something to be done, you should hone it and be proud of it, and the most important thing is that, never let the fire in your passion fades away. </div>
